A simple web application that interacts with the Internet Chuck Norris database (ICNDB)

The requirements asked for a J2EE Struts application.  However, as a .NET developer, considering the learning curve required to learn Java/Struts vs the time available for this task, along with the evaluation criteria, I have made the decision to tackle it in C#.NET.  While this clearly violates the technical criteria, I felt it best allowed me to fulfill the evaluation criteria, with particular reference to the following:-

"If you are unsure about anything, use your own judgment to create the best solution. This is just a test to show your approach to problem solving, design and software development." 

With the job being an analyst role, the initial step taken was to check with the recruiter that this test was indeed the correct test for the job.  Having been assured that it was, the decision was made to attempt the task in such a way as to best match the evaluation criteria.  Had I focused on learning and deploying Java/Struts, I'd have run out of time and had very little to show.

Tasks one and two but not three have been completed.   

Further development: further time would allow for completion of task three and the bonus tasks, the learning of Java/Struts with which to complete it or alternatively Xamarin for deploying this as a mobile app.

While the above in mind, I do hope the work committed here will still be considered for assessment.
